# JSDeque
Doubly-linked list implementation of a Deque in JavaScript

In this assignment, you will implement a double-ended queue (deque) in JavaScript
using a doubly-linked list implementation, similar to the one
that you built in Java. A deque is essentially a list with restricted operations.
In a deque, one can only add and remove items from the front or the back of the list.
Insertions and removals from the middle of the list is not allowed. Traversal
of the list is also not allowed. (Printing the list is not allowed as printing
involves traversing, or walking through the list.)
The only way to access elements of the deque is by removing the front or back element.

JavaScript may look similar to Java in some ways, but JavaScript is not
Java. The two languages are completely unrelated, but unfortunately have
similar names. The concepts of nodes and moving the links/pointers to nodes
will be the same, but there will be some differences in the code as JavaScript
does not have classes. You are provided with a working shell and two of the functions
completed. Your role is to fill in the bodies of the functions in the script.

We will use the forking model for this assignment. That means
you will fork the repository (create a duplicate copy of it)
and push changes into your fork. When you are ready, you can submit
a pull request to Ken in this original repository and Ken will
review your changes before accepting them into the original repository.
(This is a common workflow in the open source community.)

1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking] (via the the button here at GitHub).
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer (using your git client on your dev workstation).
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to your local repository.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
